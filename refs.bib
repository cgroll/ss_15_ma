  abstract =     {The popular Nelson–Siegel [Nelson, C.R., Siegel,
                  A.F., 1987. Parsimonious modeling of yield curves.
                  Journal of Business 60, 473–489] yield curve is
                  routinely fit to cross sections of intra-country
                  bond yields, and Diebold–Li [Diebold, F.X., Li, C.,

                  have recently proposed a dynamized version. In this
                  paper we extend Diebold–Li to a global context,
                  modeling a potentially large set of country yield
                  curves in a framework that allows for both global
                  and country-specific factors. In an empirical
                  analysis of term structures of government bond
                  yields for the Germany, Japan, the \{UK\} and the
                  US, we find that global yield factors do indeed
                  exist and are economically important, generally
                  explaining significant fractions of country yield
                  curve dynamics, with interesting differences across
                  countries. }
